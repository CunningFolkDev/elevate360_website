Cognitive behavioral therapy is a psychological treatment that is helpful in treating a range of problems including alcohol and drug use disorders, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders.  Research has demonstrated that CBT reliably results in improvement in both functioning and quality of life.  When using this technique, the therapist helps the patient examine their thought processes and together they identify distortions in thinking that are causing problems.
