Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Therapy (CRAFT) is a treatment approach designed specifically for people who are concerned about a loved one who is drinking or using drugs.  Developed by Dr. Robert Meyers at the University of New Mexico, this positive treatment approach can be delivered individually or in groups and leads to reduced conflict in the family and a healthier and more sustainable life for the people who are caring for someone that is struggling with alcohol or drug use.
