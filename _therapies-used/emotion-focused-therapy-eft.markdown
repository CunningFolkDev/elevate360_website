Emotionally Focused Therapy EFT or Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy EFCT is a short term (8 to 20 sessions) structured approach, originally developed for couples therapy and is based on attachment science. Interventions in EFT integrate a humanistic, experiential approach to restructuring emotional experience and a systemic structural approach to restructuring interactions. The overall goal of this treatment is to develop secure attachments and to strengthen emotional bonds. This evidence based therapy has significant research showing lasting effects of this intervention particularly for couples coping with addiction, depression, anxiety, trauma, medical illness and forgiveness dilemmas.
