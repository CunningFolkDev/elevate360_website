Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) integrates core aspects of relapse prevention with practices that teach stress reduction and cognitive behavioral therapy.   During this treatment, patients learn to recognize early warning signs for relapse, increase awareness of internal and external cues associated with alcohol and substance use, and develop effective coping skills. Additionally, mindfulness practices raise awareness of triggers, assist in monitoring internal reactions, and foster more skillful behavioral choices.
