Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) integrates core aspects of relapse prevention with practices that teach stress reduction and cognitive behavioral therapy.   During this treatment, patients learn to recognize early warning signs for relapse, increase awareness of internal and external cues associated with alcohol and substance use, and develop effective coping skills. Additionally, mindfulness practices raise awareness of triggers, assist in monitoring internal reactions, and foster more skillful behavioral choices.

Patients also learn to increase their acceptance and tolerance of various physical, emotional, and cognitive states, especially craving, thereby reducing the likelihood of utilizing substances to alleviate discomfort. In the event of a recurrence of alcohol or substance use awareness and acceptance fostered by mindfulness may aid in recognition and minimization of the blame, guilt, and negative thinking that increase risk of continued use.Â
