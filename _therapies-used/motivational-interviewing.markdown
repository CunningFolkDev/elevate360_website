Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a therapy that focuses on the natural ambivalence that people have about making changes in their behaviors and in their lives. Through this approach, the therapist guides the patient to discover new motivation and the determination to begin the process of change. Patients will also learn how to plan for the process of change and to plan for the inevitable obstacles that may occur along the way.
