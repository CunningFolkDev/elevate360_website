The community-reinforcement approach aims to move people towards recovery by eliminating positive reinforcement for drinking and drug use and enhancing positive reinforcement for non-drinking and drug using behaviors and activities. This approach integrates several treatment components, including building motivation to quit, analyzing drinking patterns, increasing pleasurable activities, learning new coping behaviors, and involving significant others in the recovery process.
