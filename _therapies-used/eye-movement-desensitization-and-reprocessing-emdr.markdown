EMDR is an evidence-based method of psychotherapy that helps people recover from the effects of psychological trauma through adaptive information processing. EMDR therapy is an eight-phase trauma treatment that comprehensively identifies and addresses experiences that have overwhelmed the brainâ€™s natural resilience or coping capacity, thereby generating traumatic symptoms and harmful coping strategies. Through EMDR therapy, patients are able to reprocess traumatic information until it is no longer psychologically disruptive.
