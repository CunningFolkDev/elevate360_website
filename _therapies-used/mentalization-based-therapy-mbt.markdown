Mentalization is the way that we understand other peopleâ€™s emotions, thoughts, desires, beliefs, and intentions. Mentalization Based Therapy is a therapeutic approach which aims to increase individuals' ability to mentalize using a manual based psychodynamic therapy. This evidence-based approach developed at the Anna Freud Institute in London, is designed to assist people in four main goals: to achieve better behavioral control, to increase affect regulation, to develop more intimate and gratifying relationships and to have the ability to pursue life goals.
