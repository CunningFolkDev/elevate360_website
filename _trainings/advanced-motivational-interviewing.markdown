In this higher-level Motivational Interviewing course, participants conduct MI sessions with Standardized Patients (SPs) and individual feedback is provided.

This course is intended to assist in the development and augmentation of skills acquisition and to increase understanding and use of motivational techniques.  It is designed for people who have attended an introductory MI workshop previously and are already using MI skills in their practice.  Participants are encouraged to bring challenging clinical cases to discuss and to receive feedback on.
