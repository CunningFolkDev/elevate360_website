Motivational Interviewing (MI) Training MI is a brief intervention designed to mobilize a patientâ€™s internal resources for change by enhancing intrinsic motivation.

It aims to reduce ambivalence about a significant change, increase self-efficacy to make the change, and thereby, increase the commitment to make the change.  MI is both a set of techniques as well as a style or way of being with a patient, which helps them to resolve ambivalence and find within themselves the resources for change.

MI trainings can be tailored to clinician skill level, patient population, location, and length of training desired.  Each training incorporates didactic instruction, video demonstration, case-based instruction, and role-plays with feedback.  Each trainee is given a folder with all training materials and will receive a Certificate of Completion at the end of training.
