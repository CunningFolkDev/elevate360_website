Introduction to Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a comprehensive, public health approach to the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for patients with alcohol and substance use disorders and for those who are at risk of developing these disorders.

Screening quickly assesses for the presence of risky substance use, follows positive screens with further assessment of problem use, and identifies the appropriate level of treatment.  Brief intervention focuses on increasing insight and awareness regarding substance use and helps to motivate the patient to make behavioral changes.  Referral to treatment provides those identified as needing more extensive treatment with access to specialty care.

SBIRT training can be specifically tailored to clinician skill level, patient population, and location. We can provide SBIRT training to healthcare professionals in all disciplines. The “Introduction to SBIRT” training is 90 minutes and incorporates didactic instruction, case-based learning, and role-play.  Each trainee is given a folder with all training materials and will receive a Certificate of Completion at the end of the training.
