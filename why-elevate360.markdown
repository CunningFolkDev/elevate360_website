        <p>In short, because we do treatment right. All our clinicians are doctorate level psychologists trained in providing care not only for substance use disorders, but also for the mental health issues that often occur along with alcohol and drug use which include depression, anxiety, trauma, compulsive behaviors, and other psychological issues. 
        </p>
        <p>
        According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), only about 10% of people struggling with addiction receive specialty addiction treatment.  Of those who engage in care, only a tiny percentage receive evidence-based care.  Comparatively, approximately 75% of people with high blood pressure and diabetes receive evidence-based treatments. Part of the reason for this is that the majority of addiction treatment staff providing care in the United States lack the knowledge, training, and education required to offer effective evidence-based treatments.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Many people donâ€™t know that addiction treatment really works. When done right, treatment for addiction is as effective as evidence-based treatments for other chronic diseases. Relapse rates for addiction resemble those of other chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. Moreover, similar to the approaches taken for other chronic diseases, successful treatment for addiction typically requires continual evaluation and ongoing care.
        </p>
        <p>
        Patients and families receiving treatment for addiction need education to learn what actually works and what just sounds like it should work. There is a big difference!
        </p>
        <p>
        We created Elevate360 to ensure that patients and their families have access to professionals who can provide information and education about available treatments, and can answer questions about which are most effective, and which will work best for them.
