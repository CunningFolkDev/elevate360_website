This program is designed for people whose lives have been significantly affected by alcohol or substance use who want to devote substantial time and effort to build skills to support their recovery.  Patients attend the program three to five days per week from 10:30am until 2:00pm receiving three hours of group therapy per day. They will also attend 1-2 individual sessions per week and may be offered family training and/or couples therapy to support their recovery as needed.
