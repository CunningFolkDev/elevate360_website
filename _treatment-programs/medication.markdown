Wholeview Wellness&reg; has strong relationships with several talented psychiatrists and physicians who can prescribe psychiatric and addiction medication when indicated. We support the use of medications in addiction treatment and will coordinate referrals and ongoing care to ensure that patients have access to medication to support their recovery.  These medications can include oral naltrexone, Vivitrol, Suboxone (buprenorphine) and others.  Also, for patients who come to us and are already in treatment with a prescribing professional, we are happy to work collaboratively with those providers.
