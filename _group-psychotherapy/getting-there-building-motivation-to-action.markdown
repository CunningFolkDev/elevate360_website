This group integrates motivational interviewing techniques with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Itâ€™s a manualized treatment that consists of 20 sessions covering a variety of topics, including making effective choices and decisions; the pace of change; roadblocks to help; internal and external triggers; family and significant others; and building a recovery environment. The group focuses on increasing internal motivation for making positive change and developing practical skills to aid the recovery process.
