This group aims to provide skills and strategies to help you manage difficult emotions, enhance your interpersonal relationships and to maintain balance in your life.  We will review the four main DBT skills modules which include Mindfulness Skills, Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills, Emotion Regulation Skills, and Distress Tolerance Skills.  Practice exercises will be assigned each week to assist in skill acquisition.  After we have reviewed and practiced the four core skills, we will work to integrate them and to make them a regular part of your daily routine.
