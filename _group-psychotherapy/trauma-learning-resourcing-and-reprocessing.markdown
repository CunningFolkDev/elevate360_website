Trauma reaches beyond memory and logic. It is stored in the body and can contribute to relapse, discomfort, anger, depression, and self-destructive behavior.  This trauma group will focus on providing supportive resources to manage hypervigilance and traumatic responses, psychoeducation on the neurobiology and physical impact of trauma, opportunities to share trauma experiences with others in a compassionate space, and exercises to move our past experiences from “the here and now” to the “there and then”.
