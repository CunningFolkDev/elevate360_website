This eight-week mindfulness-based psychotherapy group is designed for women who are interested in exploring their relationship with alcohol. Dr. Jennifer Smith leads this group in their discussions examining the positive and negative consequences of alcohol use in their lives and integrates mindfulness meditation practices into an exploration of motivation to change and traditional relapse prevention. Each week incorporates a variety of techniques utilizing mindfulness-based addiction treatment including ‘awareness of breath’, progressive muscle relaxation, and ‘body scan’. Goals for the group members are individualized and may include a reduction in stress and increased ability to respond to negative thoughts, sensations, and emotions with an attitude of nonjudgmental, acceptance, and present-moment awareness.  Participants will be asked to share their struggles and solution suggestions with one another as much as they are comfortable to do so.  Homework assignments will be given each week as increased practice of mindfulness is associated with improved outcome.
