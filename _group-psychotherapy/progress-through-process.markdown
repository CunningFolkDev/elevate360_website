Process groups are an opportunity to reflect on patterns of relating.  This includes our relationship to substances, our families, our loved ones, and to the group itself.  This group will focus on identifying feelings experienced in relationships and exploring ways of breaking unhealthy patterns and maintaining healthy ones. We will look at how different contexts in life can impact behavior and how we can begin to alter and change our relationship to these contexts.  This group emphasizes the healing power of relationships among group members and the importance of emotional understanding and attunement. The leader will stimulate the flow of dialogue and guide members in finding healthier ways to fulfill their social and emotional needs and building and in maintaining mutually rewarding and respectful relationships.
