Dr. Michelle Ritz will conduct a group using the community-reinforcement approach (CRA) which aims to help build and maintain motivation for abstinence by focusing on increasing pleasurable activities, learning new coping behaviors, and involving loved ones in the recovery process. She introduces practical skills in the group including communication skills and problem-solving skills. As this group meets on Fridays, she will also review and discuss plans for the weekend to ensure that they are both safe and enjoyable. The overall goal of CRA is to help you find healthier ways to meet your social and emotional needs and to develop a meaningful life in recovery that is more compelling than a life using alcohol or drugs.
