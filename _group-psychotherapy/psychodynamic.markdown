Dr. Bill Gottdiener will be leading a psychodynamic therapy group that will meet for 60 minutes and run for 24 weeks. Group members will be supported in discussing their personal experiences and will be taught expressive techniques to assist in identifying and working through interpersonal relationship issues.Group members will be encouraged to examine how alcohol and drugs are used in relation to their emotions and behaviors and will learn methods of problem solving that avoid the use of alcohol and drugs.The safe-space of the group will enable group members to address and resolve difficult feelings and problematic relationship patterns that may arise in the group.As members are better able to understand and express their internal experiences and emotions, they will be less inclined to use drugs and alcohol in problematic ways.
