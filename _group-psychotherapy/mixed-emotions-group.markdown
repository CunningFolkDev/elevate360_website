Join other folks in recovery to talk about the role of emotion in recovery. Whether youâ€™re feeling sad or happy, emotions and feelings can be triggers to use. Sometimes you may have mixed emotions about sobriety in general. Together we will learn how to identify emotions, how to separate our sense of self from our thoughts and feelings, and how to manage sobriety in the face of these mixed emotions
