The Next Chapter is that period in life when one is transitioning from work, raising a family, and multiple daily pressures to retirement and enjoying oneâ€™s free time at a slower pace. It is also adjusting to an empty nest, an aging body and mind, and finding new purpose and meaning. In this group, the challenges and joys of this phase of life will be discussed along with how maintaining sobriety is critical in the face of significant change and loss. Members will be encouraged to share their own personal experiences of the Next Chapter with the goal of decreasing isolation and developing a strong sense of community.
