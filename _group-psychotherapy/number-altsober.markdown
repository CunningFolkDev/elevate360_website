Drawing upon online platforms such as #Altsober, a NYC community of people devoted to ending the stigma related to addiction while welcoming a safe place for people to be open about their recovery, and Medium, a publishing platform covering a variety of topics including addiction, sobriety and recovery, Dr. Amy Colley will lead group members in an engaging discussion of weekly readings. The goal of #Altsober is to provoke new ways of thinking about living without drugs and alcohol and managing the daily struggles and joys of recovery through the personal essays of others who are on the same journey.
