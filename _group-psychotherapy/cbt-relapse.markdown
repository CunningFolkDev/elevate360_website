Dr. Amy J. Colley from Elevate360 will be leading a skill building group for individuals who are recently abstinent and are seeking support in early recovery. The group will meet for 90 minutes and run for 12 weeks. The goal of the group is to enhance self-control and raise awareness of problematic thoughts and behaviors and replace them with new more effective thoughts, skills and strategies for maintaining abstinence. Based on a cognitive behavioral model established at Yale University School of Medicine, we will focus on topics such as exploring positive and negative consequences of continued use, self-monitoring to recognize craving early on, identifying internal and external triggers, coping with cravings, practicing refusal skills, articulating goals and addressing ambivalence.  Members will have homework to support skills learned in the group meetings. Dr. Colley welcomes collaboration with group membersâ€™ individual therapists with their permission.
