We all experience situations we cannot control, behaviors that are hard to change, and intense emotions.  These can be triggers for behaviors (e.g., substance use, isolation) that reduce our ability to function effectively.  This interferes with our ability to engage with what we care about such as family, friends, work, and self-care.  As a result, we become stuck in a cycle of negative behavior that makes it harder and harder to achieve what we want in life.

This  group explores the triggers (thoughts, emotions, memories, physical pain) for avoidant behaviors and the development of willingness to commit to actions that are consistent with our values and personal goals.  The group utilizes exercises, discussions, personal examples and homework assignments to support group members in the development of greater willingness to engage in committed actions and the achievement of their goals.
