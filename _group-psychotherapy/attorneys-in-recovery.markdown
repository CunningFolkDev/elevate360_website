Dr. Sarah Church has created a 60-minute group designed for attorneys in recovery.  Legal professionals experience significantly higher rates of substance use and mental health disorders when compared to employees in other occupations, due to the nature of the legal profession which includes heavy workloads and intense competition.  Additionally, many attorneys experience frequent antagonistic interactions with other attorneys which is compounded by pressure to satisfy demanding clients while simultaneously striving to log billable hours and create new business. Attorneys encounter unique challenges in the recovery process as they attempt to achieve a healthy work-life balance.  Often, they have minimal control over their assignments and schedules and may be expected to be available for round the clock responses, which leaves little time for rest and relaxation. All of this takes place in a culture which may normalize the consumption of alcohol as part of the work environment. This treatment group provides support and will offer skills and strategies for preventing relapse and coping with stress, negative moods and achieving a healthy sustainable lifestyle.
