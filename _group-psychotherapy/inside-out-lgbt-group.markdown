Having a queer identity carries with it a series of joys, sorrows, advantages, and disadvantages, confusion, clarity, shame and celebration.  This group will explore and process varied experiences and seek to provide a space to attain an observing distance from these formative experiences.  By exploring these experiences this group will seek to better understand being queer from different contexts that contribute to our sense of self.  It is a chance to explore the need to escape, the need to numb, a fear of intimacy, hopes for the future, and how we move through life with more self-compassion and a stronger connection to others.
