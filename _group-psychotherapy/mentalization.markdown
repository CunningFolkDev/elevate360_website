Mentalization is the way that we understand other people’s emotions, thoughts, desires, beliefs, and intentions. Mentalization Based Treatment Group is a therapeutic approach which aims to increase group members’ ability to mentalize using a manual based psychodynamic therapy. This evidence-based approach developed at the Anna Freud Institute in London, is designed to assist people in four main goals: to achieve better behavioral control, to increase affect regulation, to develop more intimate and gratifying relationships and to have the ability to pursue life goals.  In this group, Dr. Sarah Church will begin by sharing the theory of mentalization and how it affects mental health. Group members will be encouraged to work together to increase their capacity to understand fellow group members and to improve their own affect regulation, to strengthen interpersonal relationships, and to reduce problematic and self-harm behaviors including alcohol and drug use.
