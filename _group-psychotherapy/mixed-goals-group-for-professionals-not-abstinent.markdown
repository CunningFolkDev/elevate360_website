Many people have concerns about some aspects of their alcohol or drug use but are not sure that they are ready to stop using for the rest of their lives. While others are clear that they want to stop using one substance such as heroin but feel that they can continue to smoke marijuana or drink alcohol moderately. Dr. Sarah Church has designed this group to assist people in taking an honest look at how they are feeling and functioning to determine what works best for them in terms of their alcohol and drug use. Group members will be encouraged to set individualized goals for moderate use or partial abstinence (e.g. abstinence from cocaine and moderate use of marijuana) and to work with the group to see if they are able to achieve their goals each week. This unique group helps people to live their life in line with their personal goals and values.
