Supportive-Expressive Therapy is an evidence-based treatment for a variety of different presenting problems, including substance use disorders. At Wholeview, we provide a specific manualized form of SET group, based on the Harvard Cocaine Recovery Project. In this approach, a substance use disorder is viewed as an outgrowth of difficulties in four areas; (1) self-esteem; (2) managing feelings; (3) managing relationships; and (4) self-care. 

SET uses two primary types of techniques: (1) supportive techniques that are designed to promote self-esteem; build knowledge and skills; reduce anxiety and other distressing feelings; encourage self-awareness; as well as build and maintain group cohesion; and (2) expressive techniques that are designed to explore and change repetitive relationship patterns that have a negative effect on one’s life; understand and modify coping patterns that have been counterproductive; and work on deepening one’s experience and expression of feelings.
