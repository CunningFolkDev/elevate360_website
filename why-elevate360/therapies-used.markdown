  callout: Our individual and group therapists utilize techniques developed by Dr.
    Beth Darnall, a psychologist and researcher at Stanford University who has designed
    psychological treatments specifically for people with chronic pain.
  copy: She has conducted research to prove the effectiveness of these techniques
    which include diaphragmatic breathing, meditation, and progressive relaxation.  These
    and other strategies assist patients in reducing their stress levels, muscular
    tension and emotional distress, all with the goal of reducing pain.  Our therapists
    assist patients in learning and practicing multiple techniques to reduce anxiety
    and pain throughout the day and at the end of day when falling asleep.
