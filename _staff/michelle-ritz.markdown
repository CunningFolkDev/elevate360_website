Dr. Michelle Ritz is a Post-Doctoral Clinical Psychology Fellow specializing in treatment of substance use disorders through psychodynamic, dialectical behavior therapy, and harm reduction approaches. She received her doctoral training at Long Island University-Post, and her graduate work has involved providing psychotherapeutic services in inpatient, partial hospitalization, and outpatient settings in the New York City region. 

Prior to beginning at Wholeview Wellness®, Dr. Ritz completed a pre-doctoral internship at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, NY. There, she served as a group and individual therapist for inpatient, day treatment, and the outpatient departments. Across these settings she adeptly tailored therapeutic interventions to work with clients suffering from a variety of issues, ranging from mild depression to psychosis. Dr. Ritz also provided individual therapy and assessment in the Women’s Health Program and the Neuropsychology Department. In her prior clinical placements at Mt. Sinai-St. Luke’s Comprehensive Adolescent Rehabilitation and Education Service and Maimonides Hospital, Dr. Ritz incorporated Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Psychosis (CBT-P) in her work with complex trauma, personality disorders, and co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders. 

Dr. Ritz’s therapeutic approach intertwines psychodynamic understanding and concepts with evidenced based interventions. She works with her individual clients to improve upon their interpersonal relationships by developing an understanding of maladaptive patterns using the Core Conflictual Relational Model. She also seeks to build their awareness and tolerance of previously intolerable affect through the use of DBT. Dr. Ritz has done community work with families through National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Her research endeavors have been centralized within the LGBTQ community, including the qualitative exploration of pleasure and sexuality.
