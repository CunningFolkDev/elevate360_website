Rich joined our team November 2020 as a CASAC intern. After a 30+ year executive career working in world class advertising agencies, the leading global live entertainment company and a leading media + content organization, Rich made the decision to begin a new career to help people overcome their substance use addictions. 

 This was driven by his desire to work in a field that gives back to people in need and create a meaningful difference in their lives.  Whatâ€™s more, the skills he developed in the corporate world, such as leading brainstorming sessions, running innovation think tanks, establishing organizational tools, building technology resources and using effective communication and reflective listening can be reframed to help our patients.
