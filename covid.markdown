In order to protect the health of our patients and staff during the coronavirus pandemic, we have temporarily moved all of our services to an HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform. All of our initial evaluations, individual psychotherapy sessions, groups and family meetings will be conducted via videoconference or by telephone.

If you would like to schedule an initial appointment or a consultation, please call us at 212-204-8430 or [contact us](/about-us/contact/). We know this is an uncertain and stressful situation and we want to be here to help.
