Group psychotherapy is a powerful therapeutic tool that can help people develop the skills needed to change negative thought patterns and cognitions.  Working through issues by participating in a group setting can reduce feelings of isolation, increase optimism, and is particularly useful in helping people learn new ways of coping with interpersonal and relationship challenges.
