Group psychotherapy is a powerful therapeutic tool that can help people develop the skills needed to change negative thought patterns and cognitions.  Working through issues by participating in a group setting can reduce feelings of isolation, increase optimism, and is particularly useful in helping people learn new ways of coping with interpersonal and relationship challenges.

Wholeview Wellness&reg; offers many different therapy groups, some are skills based, some utilize cognitive behavioral techniques to help identify and challenge problematic thought patterns, and some provide support and structure for living a balanced life.  Groups occur weekly, are from 60-90 minutes, and include up to 8 members.  Each group is led by a psychologist who guides the discussion and ensures that all members are respectful and supportive of one another. Group members are actively encouraged to provide support and feedback to one another.
