At Elevate360 all patients participate in individual sessions provided by psychologists who have expertise in treating both substance use disorders and the psychological issues that frequently occur along with alcohol and drug use, some of which include anxiety, low mood, trauma, chronic pain and compulsive behaviors.  Our therapists use multiple proven therapies including motivational and cognitive behavioral therapy and will supplement with other therapies as appropriate based on the needs of the individual patient.
