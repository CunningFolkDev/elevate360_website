At intake, and periodically during treatment, patients are asked to complete standardized questionnaires that enable us to track their progress in multiple important areas including mood, anxiety, and trauma, in addition to the use of alcohol and drugs. The outcome of these assessments helps us to tailor treatment to each patientâ€™s individual needs to ensure the best outcomes over time.
