At Wholeview Wellness we utilize Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) for couples work. This is a short term structured approach (8-20 sessions),  formulated in the early 80’s by Dr. Sue Johnson and Les Greenberg. EFT utilizes attachment theory to identify and understand what is happening in the couple relationship. 

EFT focuses on creating a safe place for exploring feelings and being more vulnerable in the relationship. Once a more secure attachment is formed, the focus shifts to addressing problems within the relationship. This can include uncovering, identifying and addressing unmet needs. Finding new ways to express needs to each other in ways that lead to fulfillment.  Past hurts and injuries will be addressed – couples will repair and reconcile and move towards acceptance and peace.

Research on the effectiveness of EFT has found that 70-75% of couples move from distress to recovery and approximately 90% show significant improvements in their relationship.
