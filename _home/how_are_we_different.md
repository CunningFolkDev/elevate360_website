The Wholeview Wellness&reg; model differs from most outpatient alcohol and drug treatment centers in that all of the therapy is provided by PhD level psychologists  who use scientifically proven techniques and who can simultaneously treat mental health disorders. 

We strive to make treatment interesting, engaging, accessible, and even, dare we say... fun for the patient.
